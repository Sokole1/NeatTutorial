"# NeatTutorial" 

Make sure you have neat and pygame installed:
pip install pygame
pip install neat-python

There are 3 python files, one where you can play the game yourself, one is to demonstarte how to use pickle to play the winner, and one is to see the AI train across generations

I left comments at the top of each python file which will give some instructions
